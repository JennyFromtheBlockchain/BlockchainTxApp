Ideas
1) Filter out transactions which are merely there to inflate the tx rate of certain coins (e.g. trx) - Get tx which type is payment?

Bugs
1) Dogechain sometimes doesn't have the data for the next block, so returns an error. Deal with this error and try next block 
(if it's likely to have been mined) - example https://dogechain.info/api/v1/block/2490273
Respons object: 
data:
      { error: "undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass", success: 0 } } }

2) The app needs to ensure that if the last row in the database is not the block before the latest, it will go and get all from that last
block in the db to the latest (within reason) - this happens in minergate_api_caller.js with xmr
3) Deal with error from coinexplorer
data:
      { success: false,
        result: [],
        error: 'Too many requests. Slow down your queries.' } } }

4) vechain api isn't retrieiving new blocks, likely not active anymore. Add vechain (from messari.io?)
